this app was made to help with daily schedule. When you open the page, you are presented with the current date and 24, hour-slots to show the time you have in the day. In each hour-slot there is a text box. When you type in each hourly timeslot, you are given the option to save the text in the box, to keep an orderly hourly schedule for the day.
